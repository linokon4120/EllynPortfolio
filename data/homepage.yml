    <p class="lead">
      <strong>I'm Ellyn (LN), a current senior studying Business Analytics and Computer Science at Bucknell University.</strong>
      Previously, I worked at PMG Worldwide Marketing Agency (2025) as a Data Analytics Intern, where I collaborated closely with the engineering team to enhance data quality and data warehousing on Snowflake and Redshift.
      I also created 10+ dynamic Tableau and Looker Studio dashboards to visualize cross-channel KPIs for 5 business clients (Sephora, Experian, Baylor Scott & White, Jazwares, Michaels), driving their reporting accuracy.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      <strong>I love helping and working with data scientists.</strong>
      Motivated by my curiosity in the power of data-driven storytelling, I have completed different data case studies spanning across industries: hospitality, e-commerce, service, and more.
      My goal is to showcase how to leverage data science in making impactful business decisions.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      <strong>My area of focus</strong> is on leveraging data science to drive business success.
      I deliver value by identifying the financial impact of challenges and providing solutions that yield a strong return on investment.
